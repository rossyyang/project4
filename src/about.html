<h2>about</h2>
<p>We are a group of folks who engage with food on a number of levels. Individually we have cooked for a living and for our families, in nearby kitchens and abroad. We have operated baking businesses, written about and photographed food production, and engaged most directly with our locally economy by farming city land. We are as interested in complicated things like food and race, as we are in the simple goodness of molasses butter spread on a warm sweet potato biscuit. We aspire to serve incredible food, but also much more.</p>
<h2>background</h2>
<p>Blacksauce Kitchen was founded in 2010 by Damian Mosley and Vesnier Lugo. Our business is an outgrowth of many things: A biscuit stand at a neighborhood farmers market. A graduate school friendship, salted in wine bars and cramped New York City apartment gatherings. Empanada parties where an absentee rolling pin often meant our dough had to be flattened with a bottle of cider vinegar. Years of scholarship, work, and residence in urban communities, face to face with nagging health disparities. Unforgettable childhood meals of crispy, fatty perníl and pillowy chicken & dumplings—some of the tastes and textures that continue to inform our craft.</p>
<h2>mission</h2>
<p>Our mission is relatively simple: to produce genuine food. In order to do it we’ve got to remain faithful to both our roots and our imagination. We spend some time studying food, for sure, but we rely just as heavily on intuition. This means we aren’t striving so much for authenticity, which is often uncompromising anyway. Rather, we strive to make food that connects with our audience; food that makes someone pause; food that prompts two girls to skip towards the tent; food that makes a man dance ever so subtly because it reminds him of another time or place; food that helps people remember.</p>
